### I'm getting "Login Fail" Error
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Check the items below one by one.

1- Check your user and password

2- If you are using a localhost or server, make sure its ip is in Turkey. If your last login was in Turkey and your server is abroad, Instagram blocks the login for security and sends you a notification. You can see this information by entering it from your phone or browser.
You can use proxy for solution. BKN : [instagram-user-login-with-proxy.php](https://github.com/Hasokeyk/instagram/blob/main/examples/user/instagram-user-login-with-proxy.php)
